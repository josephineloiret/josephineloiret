## Projects

### [OCD Treatment Recommender](https://github.com/josephineloiret/OCD-Treatment-Recommender)

A machine learning-based application that recommends personalized treatment options for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients. The system analyzes patient data and symptoms to provide evidence-based treatment recommendations, leveraging data science and AI techniques to improve mental health outcomes.

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

### [ML Drug Detection](https://github.com/josephineloiret/ML-Drug-Detection)

A machine learning project that predicts drug prescriptions based on patient characteristics including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio. The project compares four different machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks) with and without hyperparameter tuning to determine the most effective approach for drug classification. Includes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection using ANOVA, hyperparameter optimization via grid search, and performance visualization.

**Technologies:** Python, scikit-learn, scikeras, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
